# 🎙️ Live Translation (Push-to-Talk) Guide

4. Watch the translation process in real-time!

### **Step 3: Watch the Process**
The interface shows you exactly what's happening:

```
🎤 What you said: "Hello, how are you today?"
🌍 Translation: "Hola, ¿cómo estás hoy?"
```

## 🔧 **Customizable Keybind**

### **Change Your Push-to-Talk Key:**
1. Click "Change Key" button in the live translation panel

- **KeyT** - T key for "talk"
- **ControlLeft** - Left Ctrl key
- **AltLeft** - Left Alt key

## 🎯 **Live Translation Process**

When you use push-to-talk, here's what happens:

1. **🎤 Recording**: "Recording... (release key to translate)"
2. **📝 Transcribing**: "Converting speech to text..."
3. **🌍 Translating**: "Translating to target language..."
4. **🔊 Speaking**: "Speaking..." (plays through virtual microphone)
5. **✅ Ready**: "Hold [KEY] to record"

## 📊 **Real-Time Display**

The live translation panel shows:

### **Left Side - What You Said:**
- Shows your original speech in real-time
- Updates as speech-to-text processes your voice
- Shows "Listening..." while recording

### **Right Side - Translation:**
- Shows the translated text
- Updates after translation completes
- Shows "Waiting for speech..." when idle

### **Status Indicator:**
- **Gray dot**: Ready to record
- **Red pulsing dot**: Currently recording
- **Status text**: Shows current process step

## 🎵 **Audio Output**

The translated audio is played through the **virtual microphone**, which means:
- Other applications (Zoom, Teams, Discord) can hear the translation
- The translation acts as your "voice" in calls
- Perfect for real-time multilingual communication

## 🔍 **Debug Information**

Enable the debug console to see detailed logs:
- Recording status and audio data size
- Speech-to-text processing
- Translation results
- Audio synthesis and playback

## ⚡ **Quick Tips**

1. **Hold Firmly**: Make sure to hold the key down while speaking
2. **Speak Clearly**: Better speech = better translation
3. **Wait for Processing**: Let each translation complete before starting the next
4. **Check Debug**: Use debug console to troubleshoot issues
5. **Test First**: Use "🧪 Test Translation" to verify everything works

## 🎯 **Perfect For:**
