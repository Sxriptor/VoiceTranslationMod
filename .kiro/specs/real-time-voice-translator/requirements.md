# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Real-Time Voice Translator is a cross-platform desktop application built with Electron that enables real-time voice translation during voice calls. The application captures the user's English speech, translates it to a target language, synthesizes it using the user's cloned voice, and outputs it through a virtual microphone for use in any voice chat platform like Discord, Zoom, or similar applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Audio Input Capture

**User Story:** As a user, I want to capture my voice from my microphone, so that the application can process my speech for translation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL detect and list available audio input devices
2. WHEN a user selects an input device THEN the system SHALL capture audio from that device in real-time
3. WHEN audio is being captured THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating active recording
4. IF no microphone is available THEN the system SHALL display an error message and disable translation functionality

### Requirement 2: Speech-to-Text Transcription

**User Story:** As a user, I want my spoken English to be accurately transcribed, so that it can be translated to another language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is captured from the microphone THEN the system SHALL transcribe it to text using Whisper API
2. WHEN transcription is complete THEN the system SHALL display the transcribed text in the debug console
3. IF transcription fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue listening for new audio
4. WHEN audio quality is poor THEN the system SHALL attempt transcription but may produce lower accuracy results

### Requirement 3: Language Translation

**User Story:** As a user, I want my transcribed English text translated to my selected target language, so that I can communicate in that language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a target language THEN the system SHALL store this preference for the session
2. WHEN transcribed text is available THEN the system SHALL translate it to the selected target language using OpenAI, Google Translate, or DeepL API
3. WHEN translation is complete THEN the system SHALL display the translated text in the debug console
4. IF translation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and skip the TTS step for that audio segment
5. WHEN no target language is selected THEN the system SHALL default to a predefined language (e.g., Russian)

### Requirement 4: Voice Cloning and Text-to-Speech

**User Story:** As a user, I want the translated text converted to speech using my own voice, so that I maintain my vocal identity while speaking another language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user first uses the application THEN the system SHALL guide them through voice cloning setup with ElevenLabs
2. WHEN translated text is available THEN the system SHALL convert it to speech using the user's cloned voice via ElevenLabs API
3. WHEN TTS synthesis is complete THEN the system SHALL prepare the audio for output to the virtual microphone
4. IF voice cloning is not set up THEN the system SHALL use a default voice for TTS
5. IF TTS fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing new audio

### Requirement 5: Virtual Microphone Output

**User Story:** As a user, I want the translated speech sent to a virtual microphone, so that I can use it in any voice chat application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN synthesized audio is ready THEN the system SHALL send it to the configured virtual microphone device
2. WHEN virtual microphone is not available THEN the system SHALL display an error message with setup instructions
3. WHEN audio is sent to virtual microphone THEN only the translated voice SHALL be transmitted, never the original English
4. IF virtual microphone output fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and optionally play audio through system speakers

### Requirement 6: User Interface Controls

**User Story:** As a user, I want simple controls to manage the translation process, so that I can easily start, stop, and configure the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a microphone input selector with available devices
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a target language selector with supported languages
3. WHEN the user clicks the test button THEN the system SHALL process a short audio sample and play back the result
4. WHEN the user clicks start/stop toggle THEN the system SHALL activate or pause the real-time translation
5. WHEN translation is active THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indication of the current state
6. WHEN in debug mode THEN the system SHALL display a log console showing STT, translation, and TTS steps

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that temporary issues don't completely break my communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API call fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing subsequent audio
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL display a warning and attempt to reconnect
3. WHEN audio devices are disconnected THEN the system SHALL detect the change and prompt for device reselection
4. IF multiple consecutive errors occur THEN the system SHALL pause translation and notify the user
5. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically resume normal operation

### Requirement 8: Performance and Latency

**User Story:** As a user, I want minimal delay between speaking and the translated output, so that conversations feel natural.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL complete the full pipeline (STT → Translation → TTS) in under 3 seconds for typical utterances
2. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL prioritize audio processing over UI updates
3. WHEN multiple audio segments are queued THEN the system SHALL process them in order without dropping segments
4. IF processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide feedback about the delay to the user
